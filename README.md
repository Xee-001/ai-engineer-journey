# AI Engineer Journey 🚀
Hands-on AI/ML engineer transition journey with daily projects and real-world applications.

## What this repo is
This repository documents my daily, hands-on journey to transition into an AI/ML Engineer.  
Focuses on building practical skills through real-world datasets, projects, and system-level thinking rather than just theory.

## 90-Day Goal
- Build strong foundations in Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
- Work on end-to-end projects (EDA → modeling → evaluation → deployment-ready thinking)  
- Gain practical exposure to LLMs and AI engineering workflows  
- Be ready for AI/ML Engineer roles

## Tools & Tech
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
