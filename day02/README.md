# Day 02 — Modeling Starter

This folder contains starter files for Day 2: building a simple baseline model for the Telco churn dataset.

Files:
- `modeling.py`: starter script to load `day01/cleaned_telco.csv`, prepare data, train a baseline model, and print evaluation metrics.

How to run:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ajaiswal75\AI stuff\day02"
python modeling.py
```

Make sure dependencies from the project `requirements.txt` are installed and the cleaned data exists at `day01/cleaned_telco.csv`.
